## Note
The source code is outdated and it is only for the versions that written in AutoIt.
From v5.x.x, the software was rewritten in C# and there is no source code for that.

This source code is provided to you for free in the hope that you will be able to be convinced that there is not any malicious code included.  
Because the software is written in Autoit and is very popular, I was not able to deal with the "suspicious program" concern that some users have. The thing that changed the game was the fact that google.com erroneously blocked the software's website due to the "suspicious program" concern.
